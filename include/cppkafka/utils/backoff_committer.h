/**
 * \brief Allows performing synchronous commits that will backoff until successful
 *
 * This class serves as a simple wrapper around Consumer::commit, allowing to commit
 * messages and topic/partition/offset tuples handling errors and performing a backoff
 * whenever the commit fails.
 *
 * Both linear and exponential backoff policies are supported, the former one being
 * the default.
 *
 * Example code on how to use this:
 *
 * \code
 * // Create a consumer
 * Consumer consumer(...);
 *
 * // Create a committer using this consumer
 * BackoffCommitter committer(consumer);
 *
 * // Set an error callback. This is optional and allows having some feedback 
 * // when commits fail. If the callback returns false, then this message won't
 * // be committer again.
 * committer.set_error_callback([](Error error) {
 *     cout << "Error committing: " << error << endl;
 *     return true; 
 * });
 *
 * // Now commit. If there's an error, this will retry forever
 * committer.commit(some_message);
 * \endcode
